                    <b>My name is Adam Eckert.</b>
                    I am a game designer and 2021 graduate of <b>Arizona State University</b>, where I studied Informatics and took a certificate in video game development at the Fulton School of Engineering.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>I also was a Design Lead at a student-led game development organization</b> at ASU, publishing under the name <b><i>Heatwave Studios</i></b>.
                    <br><br>
                    Through hobbyist, academic, and <i>Heatwave Studios</i> projects, I have:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worked with teams ranging from solo-development to tens of people across disciplines</li>
                        <li>Learned and implemented SCRUM concepts to see projects from inception to completion</li>
                        <li>Facilitated communication between people with different specialties</li>
                        <li>Produced documentation standards to train new designers at <i>Heatwave Studios</i></li>
                        <li>Created all assets for solo projects, including code, music, and art</li>
                        <li>Discovered learning opportunities in every project</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Looking forward, I'm interested in focusing more on accessibility.
                    There are people from every walk of life who want to play games, and accomodating the needs of those who are often overlooked is something I would love to have a part in.
