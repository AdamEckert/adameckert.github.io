                    Thank you for checking out my portfolio website!
                    <br><br>
                    I've been developing games since I learned GameMaker 8.1 in middle school (starting with my inaugural 2D-minecraft game) and fell in love with game development as much as I had already fallen in love with gaming. Realizing an idea into a fully-fledged product is incredibly satisfying, and I love pushing the limits of what I can do by presenting those ideas in unique, visually striking ways.
                    <br><br>
                    In college, I went on to study Informatics with a focus on video game development at Arizona State University, and graduated in May of 2021.
                    <br><br>
                    I was also a member of Heatwave Studio, the ASU Video Game Development Club, where I worked on four different games, one for each academic year.
                    For my last two years at the club, I was an officer of the design team, where I helped allocate tasks among members and served as a general resource for them, including training in documentation and Unity skills.
                    It has been a joy to collaborate with others, teach new club members, and see the creative work everybody on a team can offer.
                    <br><br>
                    I am excited to share my own strengths and experiences along with my peers in the workplace!
