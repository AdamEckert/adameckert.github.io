                    <i>Dodger</i> is actually a remake of a game I made at the end of middle school of the same name.
                    The original concept was to reverse the mechanic of damaging the player upon touching an enemy.
                    This changed over time, until it became a game about standing in a small moving zone while dodging lots of projectiles and collecting upgrades.

                    My first attempt at this was rough around the edges, but upon replaying it years later I discovered that the loop of weaving in an out of the enemy's range still shined through.
                    This inspired me to give a go at recreating it with my current skills to produce a much stronger overall project that could push that appeal to the max.

                    Developed off-and-on over a couple years, I overhauled the aesthetic, created music, and added multiple concurrent gameplay systems to create a more involved and engaging experience.
                    <b>I'm proud of the dynamic push-and-pull to the game's systems, offering many on-the-fly decisions and risk-reward scenarios for the player couched in a straightforward and engrossing gameplay loop.</b>
                    I could talk on and on about the design of this game, so please ask if you want to hear more!

                    At some point while developing <i>Dodger</i>, I concocted many grand ideas about its overall structure.
                    A narrative about a lost space traveler searching for an escape from an endless loop of warping from planet to planet began forming in my mind.
                    Yet, when it came to integrating that into the existing mechanics of the project, I became completely stalled.
                    I soon realized that these ideas were pulling me away from the direction the project was naturally going in.
                    In the end, <i>Dodger</i> ended up providing no narrative context for any of its strange, abstract elements, and I realized that it didn't need that in the first place to succeed at what it was meant to do.
