                    <i>Dodger</i> is actually a remake of a game I made at the end of middle school of the same name, challenging the player to stay within a small moving zone while dodging projectiles and collecting upgrades.

                    After replaying the original version I realized that, despite being rough around the edges, the gameplay loop had me hooked.
                    I was inspired to recreate it with my current skills and see what more I could do with the concept.

                    Developed off-and-on over a couple years, I developed a new aesthetic, created music, and added multiple concurrent gameplay systems to create a more involved and engaging experience.
                    <b>I'm proud of the dynamic push-and-pull to the game's systems, offering many on-the-fly decisions and risk-reward scenarios for the player couched in a straightforward and engrossing gameplay loop.</b>
                    I could talk for a while about the design of this game, so please ask if you want to hear more!

                    At some point while developing <i>Dodger</i>, I concocted many grand ideas about its overall structure, with a grand in-game narrative forming in my mind.
                    Yet, when it came to integrating that into the existing mechanics of the project, I became completely stalled.
                    I soon realized that these ideas were pulling me away from the direction the project was naturally going in.
                    In the end, I provided no narrative context for any of the games strange, abstract elements, as I realized that none of that contributed to the game's core appeal.
