                    <i>Chromaslice</i> is a simple, fast-paced party game where you and your teammate fight with the laser that tethers you together.
                    You fight on 5 different maps with various hazards or entities.

                    This was the first project I participated in with the Video Game Development Club at ASU. I was involved in design discussions and as a regular design team member I picked up various tasks.
                    This includes a lot of miscellaneous documentation, largely focused on playtesting, bug reporting, and patch notes, as well as prototyping and implementing improved player movement code according to discussions had in club.

                    This project saw a lot of time and energy spent into debating the inclusion of certain elements.
                    In the end, very few of these possibilities ended up in the game, and the extended discussions we had about them only got in the way of doing other, more important work
                    (ask me about jumping...)

                    Going forward, our club has stressed the president's ability to step in and make executive decisions in cases like this.
