                    In response to the issues we encountered during Color Phaseâ€™s development, I began working on a new set of documentation standards the Summer after I was elected design officer.
                    These standards were intended to keep our documentation consistent and effective, and present the file organization nightmares we found ourselves with before.
                    I was the sole author of these standards in my Junior year, and my partner Design Officer and I collaborated on creating training exercises for new members.
                    As a Senior, both the standards and exercises were revised by myself and our new Design Officer for the next year's project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The document is broken into three sections, covering document structure, document content, and file management respectively.
                    My primary goal was to be fully comprehensive to minimize confusion during development.
                    Not all the standards were upheld and followed, as there were some drawbacks to my approach (I will discuss these in the <i>Lessons Learned</i> section) but these guidelines were certainly successful in some key ways.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most important takeaway from these documentation standards was the emphasis that documentation is a tool for communicating with others.
                    It's very easy for new designers to write documentation that makes sense to <i>them</i>, but not anybody else.
                    Even when not holding strictly to the outlined instructions, using this to train members went a long way in reframing their work as something specifically meant to convey ideas to members of other teams.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, when first writing these standards, I decided to specify that the player should be referred to with the pronoun "they" for the sake of inclusivity.
                    When I first used this document to train new members, I felt a little unsure as to whether this was a necessary inclusion.
                    However, I was later told by a fellow officer who joined that year that it helped her know the club would be a good place to be when gaming in general is such a male-dominated space.

                </div>
                
                <div id="heading">
                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                </div>
                <div id="section">

                    <b>Keep a balance between organization and flexibility.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Standardization is good, but it should remain flexible enough for each project.
                    While attempting to create a more consistent, formalized process, I did not consider the needs of each specific project nor the living nature of documentation.
                    While this did not lead to any particular hang-ups in development, certain parts of these standards (particularly the approval process)
                    were effectively ignored at times due to their impracticability in regard to our present approach.
