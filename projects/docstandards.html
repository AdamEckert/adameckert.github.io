                    After the issues during <i>Color Phase</i>'s development, my first project as a Design Lead was to develop documentation standards.
                    Their primary intention was to ensure our documentation is consistent, effective, and well organized.
                    While I initially wrote these on my own, they have also seen later revision from myself and other Design Leads.

                    <br>
                    These standards are divided into three sections, covering structure, content, and filemanagement.
                    This provided us with a strong foundation for training new designers, and helped frame their work as a means of communication between various members and teams.

                <div id="heading">
                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                </div>
                <div id="section">

                    <b>Keep a balance between organization and flexibility.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Standardization is good, but it should remain flexible enough for each project.
                    In my attempt to make comprehensive guidelines before even starting our next game, I did not consider the needs of the specific project nor the living nature of documentation.
                    While this didn't cause any hang-ups in development, parts of these standards proved to be of little use during our next project.
