                    In response to the issues we encountered during Color Phaseâ€™s development, I began working on a new set of documentation standards the Summer after I was elected design officer.
                    These standards were intended to keep our documentation consistent and effective, and present the file organization nightmares we found ourselves with before.
                    I was the sole author of these standards in my Junior year, and my partner Design Officer and I collaborated on creating training exercises for new members.
                    As a Senior, both the standards and exercises were revised by myself and our new Design Officer for the next year's project.

                    <br>
                    The document is broken into three sections, covering document structure, document content, and file management respectively.
                    My primary goal was to be fully comprehensive to minimize confusion during development.
                    Not all the standards were upheld and followed, as there were some drawbacks to my approach (I will discuss these in the <i>Lessons Learned</i> section) but these guidelines were certainly successful in some key ways.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most importantly, these standards acted to give incoming designers insight into what their role on the team actually is, and helped them understand the utility of documentation as a tool for communication.
                    Even when not holding strictly to these standards, they knew the purpose of what they were doing and understood the attention to detail it requires.

                <div id="heading">
                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                </div>
                <div id="section">

                    <b>Keep a balance between organization and flexibility.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Standardization is good, but it should remain flexible enough for each project.
                    While attempting to create a more consistent, formalized process, I did not consider the needs of each specific project nor the living nature of documentation.
                    While this did not lead to any particular hang-ups in development, certain parts of these standards (particularly the approval process)
                    were effectively ignored at times due to their impracticability in regard to our present approach.
