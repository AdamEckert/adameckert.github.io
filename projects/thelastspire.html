                    Working under interesting limitations and using clever tricks to create fun visual effects (especially 3D effects) are two of my favorite things to do in game development, and <i>The Last Spire</i> is a great example of this.

                    My goal with this game was to create a 3D gamespace without any of the 3D functionality built into GameMaker to create an authentic retro look... and just for the sake of trying it out!
                    I had a blast conceptualizing and building the infrastructure for this game (which could be seen as an extension of the approach I took in <i><a href="finalfrontiersman.html">The Final Frontiersman</a></i>)
                    from its multiple coordinate systems to the rendering pipeline. I love talking about how I've implemented this sort of thing, so ask if you want to hear about it!
                    <br><br>
                    Planning and implementing this all on the fly in 48 hours was a challenge, and it certainly wasn't without flaw, but I thoroughly enjoyed the project and I feel very satisfied with what I was able to do with it.

                    <b>Don't assume it'll just work out, PLAYTEST!</b>
                    <br>
                    Having run through most of my development time, the end of the jam saw me scrambling to implement a few last minute features without properly playtesting them all.
                    As such, the final product ended up with a wild difficulty spike around wave 6.
                    While I had fun developing these systems, it was disappointing to see players unable to spend much time with them due to the game's poor balancing.

                    <b>Keep evaluating what adds or takes away from the experience.</b>
                    <br>
                    Alongside the 3D effect, I also adhered to the same input limitations seen in the GBJam just for fun.
                    While I have fun designing under such constraints, the most consistent feedback the game received was that it would feel much better had it supported mouse controls.
                    Such a thought never crossed my mind during development, but it serves as a reminder that what I have the most fun with as a designer doesn't always necessarily result in the best player experience.
