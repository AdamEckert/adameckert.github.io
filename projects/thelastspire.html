                    Working under interesting limitations and creating unique, striking effects (especially 3D effects) using simple sprite rendering are two of my favorite things to do in game development.
                    While these are represented in a number of games on my portfolio, <i>The Last Spire</i> probably encapsulates both of these the most.
                    <br><br>
                    Developing the systems of <i>The Last Spire</i> was tons of fun, especially since its first person perspective was kind of a continuation of the systems I had created for <i>The Final Frontiersman</i>.
                    In <i>TFF</i>, entities had internal polar coordinates representing their location around the central planet, which would then be translated into cartesian screenspace coordinates for rendering.
                    This is also true for <i>TLS</i>, as it too featured a rotating field of view around a stationary center.
                    However, some enemy behavior in <i>TLS</i> is relative to the world instead of the player's axis of rotation, so I also gave them a cartesian world-space coordinate.
                    All of this means that, for the basic enemy, their movement was calculated in 3D cartesian space, which was then converted to cylindrical coordinates relative to the player, which was <i>then</i> converted into 2D screenspace coordinates for rendering.
                    <br><br>
                    Planning and writing out it all out on the fly in 48 hours was a challenge, but my goodness if it wasn't a blast to program!
                    As I'm writing this, my mind still can't help but think about different ways I could push this system to its limits.
                    Even with the game's flaws, which I'll discuss in the Lessons Learned section, I feel very satisfied thinking back to what I was able to do with it.

                    <b>Don't assume it'll just work out, PLAYTEST!</b>
                    <br>
                    Having run through most of my development time, at the end of the jam I was mostly in a rush to add a small handful of enemy types and ship the game, as well as a simple local high score system.
                    However, I did not leave enough time to properly playtest, and as such the final product ended up with a wildly unbalanced mothership enemy that made the game basically entirely unplayable past wave 6.
                    As much fun as it was to develop all these systems, it was very disappointing to realize that this insane difficulty spike meant players wouldn't get to properly enjoy them.

                    <b>Always be re-evaluating what contributes to the experience and what takes away from it.</b>
                    <br>
                    Aside from the endeavor of mimicking 3D behavior, I also gave myself the input limitation of having the entire game playable with only a D-Pad and two buttons, similar to the restrictions of the Game Boy Jam.
                    While I always have fun designing around such a simplified control system, what was probably the most consistent feedback I received was that the game would feel much better to play had I implemented mouse controls.
                    Funnily enough, I never even stopped to consider that players might feel this way during development, as I had already fallen in love with my control setup by the time I entered the deep mathematical stupor that was most of this game's development process.
