                    <i>Kuri</i> was my first full-fledged project, made for my video game design class in Senior year of high school.
                    The class was very free-form, but introduced us to basic SCRUM concepts, directing students to create a product backlog and self-manage sprints through a development cycle that lasted about six months.

                    </video>
                    Largely taking inspiration from the then recently-released boss rush <i>Furi</i>, <i>Kuri</i> featured three bosses with many attacks and multiple healthbars, along with a variety of abilities for the player, introduced as you progress through the game.

                    It was definitely an ambitious project, especially with art assets and music on my plate as well, and as a result it's easy to see where the game is rough around the edges.
                    Still, after it was done, I remember watching one classmate who sat in front of me struggling through the final boss, long after all the others had given up, and finally achieve the satisfaction of a hard-fought victory;
                    Seeing that, I knew the game succeeded at appealing to its target niche. I'm pretty proud of this one.

                    Kuriâ€™s initial concept included an interactive upgrade system and some dialogue/cutscenes to explicitly state the lore of the world.
                    However, I eventually realized that the scope and vision of the project would be better served by leaving out these elements,
                    allowing me to focus solely on filling out the content of each battle and improving general gameplay stability.
