                    <i>Kuri</i> was my first full-fledged project, made for my video game design class in Senior year of high school.
                    I created all assets for this game, including code, art, and music.
                    The class was very free-form, but <b>introduced us to basic SCRUM concepts, directing students to create a product backlog and self-manage sprints through a development cycle that lasted about six months.</b>

                <div id="section">
                    <video class="r" id="video" width="480" height="270" controls>
                        <source src="/videos/kurivideo720.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                    Largely taking inspiration from the then recently-released boss rush <i>Furi</i>, <i>Kuri</i> featured three bosses with many attacks and multiple healthbars, along with a variety of abilities for the player, introduced as you progress through the game.

                    It was definitely an ambitious project, especially with art assets and music on my plate as well, and it's easy to see where it's rough around the edges.
                    Still, I remember watching one particular classmate who excitedly struggled all the way through to his hard-fought victory, and feeling assured that I succeeded at what I set out to do.
                    I'm pretty proud of this one.

                    Kuri's initial concept included an interactive upgrade system and some dialogue/cutscenes to explicitly state the lore of the world.
                    However, I eventually realized that the scope and vision of the project would be better served by leaving out these elements,
                    allowing me to focus solely on filling out the content of each battle and improving general gameplay stability.
