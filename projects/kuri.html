                    <i>Kuri</i> was my first full-fledged project, made for my video game design class in Senior year of high school.
                    The class was very free-form, but introduced us to basic SCRUM concepts, directing students to create a product backlog and self-manage sprints throughout the academic year on our final game project.
                    The game itself I am very proud of, despite being pretty rough around the edges, for overal being a solid, varied, and rather stable experience.
                    <br><br>
                    Largely taking influence from <i>Furi</i>, a boss rush game that had recently released at the time and is still among my favorites,
                    I aimed for a somewhat serious tone with <i>Kuri</i>, with increasingly dramatic music and the classic <i>mysterious cloaked indie game protagonist!</i>
                    I also used <i>Furi</i> as a mechanical reference, particularly with the multi-stage structure of bosses and a large array of abilities for the player to use.
                    <br<br>
                    In terms of content, the game has:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three boss fights, with two phases that have 3-4 attacks each</li>
                        <li>Three abilities on top of the player's basic attack, introduced to the player over the course of the game</li>
                        <li>Three original songs</li>
                        <li>Simple environment art for each boss</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    While its difficulty made <i>Kuri</i> alienating to many of the students, I remember one in particular who struggled his way to victory when we shared our final products with each other.
                    Seeing him sink his teeth into the game had me confident that, while its appeal was niche, I had successfully done what I set out to do.
                    In the end, <i>Kuri</i> was voted as the best of our game projects by my classmates.
                    <br><br>
                    The teacher of that class also made us posters and physical copies of our games using promotional material we made in class.
                    (I'm quite proud of the review quotes I got from those who sat next to me, heh!)

                    <br>
                    Kuriâ€™s initial concept included an interactive upgrade system and some dialogue/cutscenes to explicitly state the lore of the world.
                    However, I eventually realized that the scope and vision of the project would be better served by leaving out these elements,
                    allowing me to focus solely on filling out the content of each battle and improving general gameplay stability.
