                    <i>Death Dweller</i> was made for the 7th GBJam, in which jammers must work within graphical and input restrictions to mimic the original Gameboy.
                    Break open a mysterious box, then fight the escaped spirits it contained!
                    <br>
                    I am very proud of this game for its atmosphere, aesthetic, and, most significantly, the level of mechanical depth I was able to include within the jam's restrictions.

                    Adapting my previous style of top-down twin-stick combat was a very satisfying design challenge.
                    The player can use the directional inputs to move, while one face button is bound to attacking and the other slows you down for precise movement.
                    Pressing the attack button triggers a melee attack, and holding it produces a steady stream of bullets.
                    <br><br>
                    Adding the ability to aim was not feasible for these input restrictions, so I locked the player's aim to always face the enemy instead.
                    However, other systems allowed to make up for this loss in complexity.
                    As most enemies attack radially from their center, standing close enough to land a melee strike is significantly more dangerous than staying farther back, and having to manage that trade-off between damage output and safety contributes a lot to the exciting tension of combat.
                    <br><br>
                    The second boss, Vague Malice, plays with the auto-aiming restriction a little differently.
                    It is the only boss that, during some attacks, moves continuously throughout the playspace.
                    This forces the player to take the travel time of their projectiles into account, and position themselves correctly to land them.
                    This idea was not perfectly executed, as some players thought it was a frustrating oversight instead of an intentional choice.
                    Nevertheless, I am proud of the idea to use this as a stand-in for a more traditional aiming system and a unique characteristic for this enemy.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also quite happy with the visual presentation of the game, and that is especially highlighted in the third boss, Pious Light.
                    This boss uses sprite-stacking to create a 3D effect, both in its own design and in the hazards it employs.
                    In its first attack, four 3D shields emerge, casting dark shadows out from the center of the playfield.
                    (This striking radial shadow effect was actually one of the first ideas I had wanted to implement, and it ended up coming out exactly how I had envisioned!)
                    As the attack progresses, these shadows leave behind dark circles, from which 3D spike obstacles emerge for a time before disappearing when enveloped in shadow again.

                    During the development of Death Dweller, I realized that the color pallete may be difficult for players with certain visual impairments to parse.
                    However, not wanting to revisit spritework that was already complete, I dismissed the concern, resolving that “it’s not like a legally blind person is going to play my game.”
                    <br>
                    ...Well, egg on my face when I personally received feedback from another GBJam dev who loved my game, but had some trouble playing it <i>because they were legally blind</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    Considering it was still a jam game, I don't know if I really had the time to make appropraite accomodations either way.
                    Regardless, this experience reminded me that all types of people want to play games, and it's important to give their needs the earnest consideration they deserve.
