                    <i>Death Dweller</i> was made for the 7th GBJam, in which jammers must work within certain graphical and input restrictions to mimic the original Gameboy.
                </div>

                <div id="section">
                    <video class="r" id="video" width="300" height="270" controls>
                        <source src="/videos/ddvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                    </video>
                    I had a great time adapting my design ideas to the input limitations of the jam. The controls had to be simplified from the twin-stick system I was used to for boss-rushes, and I think it worked out great.
                    Part of this was introducing a melee attack (attack button press) alongside the ranged attack (attack button hold), allowing the player to deal more damage when in close range.
                    Since I had to remove manual aiming due to a lack of available inputs, this added an element of risk-reward that keeps the core gameplay engaging without relying on any additional mappings.

                    What shines most about this game, though, is its aesthetic strength, which takes advantage of a few different techniques to look as striking as possible.
                    This includes the 3D effect on certain entities as well as the different visual ideas used in each boss's design. In specific, the first attack of the third boss (34 seconds into the video) is my favorite moment in the game.
                    The lantern with shields floating around it, casting wide shadows across the map with spikes that appear and disappear in their wake... I love it!
                    This pattern makes the most of the game's visual and mechanical focus, and it came together exactly how I envisioned it.

                    During the development of Death Dweller, I realized that the color pallete may be difficult for players with certain visual impairments to parse.
                    However, not wanting to revisit spritework that was already complete, I dismissed the concern, resolving that “it’s not like a legally blind person is going to play my game.”
                    <br>
                    ...Well, egg on my face when I personally received feedback from another GBJam dev who loved my game, but had some trouble playing it <i>because they were legally blind</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    Considering it was still a jam game, I don't know if I really had the time to make appropraite accomodations either way.
                    Regardless, this experience reminded me that all types of people want to play games, and it's important to give their needs the earnest consideration they deserve.
