                    As with most jam games, The Final Frontiersman was made with the primary intentions of realizing simple mechanics in a number of interesting ways and standing out on an aesthetic standpoint.
                    Specifically, my goal was to keep the player very simple and standard, but bring interest through each level’s distinct focus, such as exponentially dividing enemies of the slime planet and verticality in the water planet.

                <div id="heading">
                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                </div>
                <div id="section">
                    <b>When things get rough, persevere!</b>
                    At about two-thirds of the way through the jam, I had not made as much progress as I had hoped, and felt so dejected that I considered dropping of the jam entirely.
                    However, I resolved to work extra hard for just a bit longer, and soon found myself coming down the other side of the hump.
                    Games take a lot of work and it’s easy to feel down, but when things start coming together it can breathe new life into your motivation.
