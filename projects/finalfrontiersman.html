                    <i>The Final Frontiersman</i> was made for the 34th GM48 game jam, with "Small World" as the theme. You play as a space cowboy up against the hostile life on three different tiny planets, each one with their own little twist!
                    This project is perhaps my favorite to date, featuring simple and satisfying gameplay with a unique presentation.

                <div id="section">
                    <video class="r" id="video" width="480" height="270" controls>
                        <source src="/videos/tffvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                    </video>
                    The variety of the levels is perhaps my proudest point, with enemies and environments that make good on the gimmick of the game's presentation yet each have their own unique appeal.
                    I'm especially proud of the efficiency of the design.
                    Despite having very similar functionality, I only needed to make small tweaks to enemy behavior to produce a very different experience for each section of the game.
                    This is also true for the water level, which is spiced up a lot with its extra level of verticality, even though it isn't functionally different in other ways.
                    <br><br>
                    On a separate note, I also just really enjoyed making this game.
                    I love working under unique limitations as well as any excuse to play around with some fun math, both of which this game's systems served to provide (and were further developed in <i><a href="thelastspire.html">The Last Spire</a></i>.)

                </div>
                <div id="section">

                    <b>Perserverance is key!</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Halfway through the jam, I was feeling pessimistic about the progress I had made and considered dropping the project altogether.
                    However, after deciding to give it just a few more hours of focused work, I soon realized that the game was much closer to completion than I had thought.
                    That's not to say I wasn't short on time, but this only served as inspiration for the more efficient designs of each level and resulted in a project that is still among my favorites.
