                    <i>The Final Frontiersman</i> was made for the 34th GM48 game jam, with "Small World" as the theme. You play as a space cowboy up against the hostile life on three different tiny planets, each one with their own little twist!
                    This project is perhaps my favorite to date, featuring simple and satisfying gameplay with a unique presentation.

                    I love the variety of each level, from the tumbleweeds and charging bulls of the bandit planet, to the exponentially subdividing slimes of the slime planet, to the expanded verticality of the water planet.
                    What excites me most about this, though, is how efficient this variety is.
                    Most of the enemy behavior is very similar, but the slightest changes to them or their environment can create a whole different experience without requiring too much labor.
                    For instance, the fish-with-legs of the water planet is mechanically identical to the bull from the bandit planet, but when the play-space is opened up to include the area underneath the planet's surface, it is recontextualized to accentuate the unique appeal of that level.

                    As I'll touch on again in the Lessons Learned section, <i>The Final Frontiersman</i> is a great example of "work smart, not hard" (though, I <i>did</i> work pretty hard on it!)
                    Creating under unique limitations is one of my favorite parts of game development, and this game embodies that passion better than any of my other work (though it's rivaled by <i><a href="thelastspire.html">The Last Spire</a></i>.)

                    Throughout most of this jam, I felt very pessimistic about my chances of finishing the project, and even considered dropping it midway through.
                    However, right when my morale was at its lowest, I resolved to work at least a few more hours before throwing in the towel.
                    That small burst of progress got me over the hump, and I soon realized I was much more capable of finishing the game than I thought.
                    Since time was still short, I had to focus my design approach on efficiency.
                    This actually served more as an inspiration than anything, and the ideas I implemented as a result came together to create one of my favorite projects that I've worked on.
