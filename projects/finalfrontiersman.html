                    <i>The Final Frontiersman</i> was made for the 34th GM48 game jam, with "Small World" as the theme.
                    You play as a space cowboy up against the hostile life on three different tiny planets, each one with their own little twist!
                    <br>
                    This project is perhaps my favorite to date, featuring simple and satisfying gameplay, unique presentation, and mechanically distinct levels that push the base mechanics to their limit.
                    <br><br>
                    And, of course, I think it's got some funny charm too!

                            <h1>Bandit Planet</h1>
                        </div>
                        On the Bandit Planet, you face off against simple running and shooting bandits to introduce the gameplay systems.
                        With every wave you complete, a bouncing tumbleweed will blow into the fray. These can't be destroyed, but can be deflected by shooting them (or, simply dodged, if that's more your style!)
                        Right when you've gotten the hang of it, be ready to face a charging bull! These creatures have lots of health and run towards you incredibly fast, but they have trouble slowing down. Try jumping over and loading into them while they turn around.

                            <h1>Slime Planet</h1>
                        </div>
                        Next comes the Slime Planet.
                        Rather than diversifying their strategies, the slimes opt to overwhelm you with numbers.
                        Each one you kill splits into two more, so don't be careless if you want to avoid a sticky (or slimey) situation!
                        After the first wave, some newly born slimes mutate into flying slimes. These enemies shoot at you from above, and getting back at them requires a jump.

                        <h1>Water Planet</h1>
                    </div>
                    The Water Planet is famous vacation spot throughout the galaxy, increasing verticality by letting players enjoy a swim below its surface.
                    Down here, you'll find schools of fish with varying colors, while a flock of seagulls (the animals, not the band) flies the sky above - just be sure to avoid their droppings.
                    However, don't get too comfy! Rumors of cryptid sightings are what this vacation planet is most known for, specifically a particularly aggressive fish with... human legs?

                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>

                <div id="section">

                    <b>Perserverance is key!</b>
                    <br>
                    A lot of work goes into games, and its easy to feel like the end is impossibly far away; but, if you push yourself just a bit further, you might find things were better than you thought.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout most of this jam, I felt very pessimistic about my chances at even finishing the project, and even considered dropping it midway through.
                    However, right when my morale was at its lowest, I resolved to work at least a few more hours before throwing in the towel.
                    In the end, that small burst of progress is all I needed to get over that hump, and the game I ended up with is one I'm very proud of.
