                    <i>The Final Frontiersman</i> was made for the 34th GM48 game jam, with "Small World" as the theme.
                    You play as a space cowboy up against the hostile life on three different tiny planets, each one with their own little twist!
                    <br>
                    This project is perhaps my favorite to date, featuring simple and satisfying gameplay, a unique style of presentation, and mechanically distinct enemies that push the base mechanics of the game to their limit.
                    <br><br>
                    And, of course, I think it's pretty funny too!

                <div id="section">
                    <b>When things get rough, persevere!</b>
                    At about two-thirds of the way through the jam, I had not made as much progress as I had hoped, and felt so dejected that I considered dropping of the jam entirely.
                    However, I resolved to work extra hard for just a bit longer, and soon found myself coming down the other side of the hump.
                    Games take a lot of work and itâ€™s easy to feel down, but when things start coming together it can breathe new life into your motivation.
