                    <i>The Final Frontiersman</i> was made for the 34th GM48 game jam, with "Small World" as the theme. You play as a space cowboy up against the hostile life on three tiny planets, each with their own twist.
                    This project is perhaps my favorite jam to date, featuring simple and satisfying gameplay with an engaging presentation and flow.

                    The level variety is a strong point, with enemies and environments that have their own appeals and spin on the game's visual style.
                    I'm especially proud of the efficiency of the game's design.
                    While playing each level gives you a very different experience, this was achieved using simple tweaks on existing enemy functionality.
                    The water level goes a little further, spicing up gameplay by allowing you to swim beneath the surface, adding verticality by creating multiple strata of enemies without much additional work.

                    On a separate note, I also just really enjoyed making this game.
                    I love giving myself limitations to work under as well as any excuse to play around with some fun math, both of which this game's systems served to provide (and were further developed in <i><a href="thelastspire.html">The Last Spire</a></i>.)

                    Halfway through the jam, I was feeling pessimistic about the progress I had made and considered dropping the project altogether.
                    However, after deciding to give it just a few more hours of focused work, I soon realized that the game was much closer to completion than I had thought.
                    That's not to say I wasn't still fighting against the clock, but this only served as inspiration for the more efficient designs of each level and resulted in a project that remains among my favorites.
