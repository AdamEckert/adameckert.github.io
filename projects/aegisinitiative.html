                    <i>Aegis Initiative</i> was my final project with the Video Game Development Club at ASU, and was developed entirely through online meetings due to the ongoing pandemic.

                    The game is a 3D shooter in the vein of <i>Star Fox</i>, with a number copilots that offer you abilities and each have their own story to unlock.
                    The job of the design officers was largely to direct brainstorming sessions among members and divy up tasks.
                    Eventually, design members were each assigned to different stages and character stories, and our job as officers was largely to be a resource and maintain communication between our team and others.

                    When we initially voted on which game idea to pursue, two ideas tied for first place: a <i>Star Fox</i>-style 3D shooter which I had pitched, and something along the lines of the chao garden from <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i>.
                    The decision was made to merge these ideas into one, which resulted in the numerous co-pilots with individual story progression.
                    Looking back, I believe that merging of these ideas resulted in a larger scope of design and implementation than what the club could reasonably take on, and hampered the game's development process.
