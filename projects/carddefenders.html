                    <i>Card Defenders</i> was my capstone project, made with a group of three other students.
                    The core concept is to combine tower defense gameplay with card game mechanics, including deck building and random card draw.
                    My role as lead designer had me primarily working on design, documentation, and playtesting, though many design ideas were collaboratively conceived of by the group.
                    <br><br>
                    I made most of the decisions around the enemy and card designs, though, and I'm very proud of how they worked out!
                    Choosing what to put in your deck is not an arbitrary choice, and the different behaviors of each enemy push you to re-evaluate your approach and think about how you're using all of the mechanics at your disposal.
                    This strategy resultant from the variety of mechanics on display really makes good on the premise, and allows the game to succeed in scratching both a tower defense and card game itch for players.

                    At the beginning of our capstone, my team knew we wanted to make a game, but we weren't sure what type of project would be considered appropriate for the class.
                    Initially, we planned on making an educational game focused around graphing functions, thinking that those in charge of our class wouldn't allow a game project unless it offered some other utility than... well, being a game.
                    At the last second, though, our friend and groupmate Connor laid it out for us - if we want to make a game, we should at least try to make a game we're actually passionate about.
                    So, we decided to give it a try, and proposed <i>Card Defenders</i> as our capstone project.
                    Unfortunately, it didn't work out, and <i>Card Defenders</i> never got made... ;)
