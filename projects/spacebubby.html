                    <i>Space Bubby</i> was a spiritual successor to Kuri, made for my first game development class at ASU.
                    While this class was similarly free-form, I was able to take the development process I had learned from my last academic project and apply it to my small group.
                    
                    My partner and I started by developing our initial plan for gameplay structure and content goals, then broke it down into a number of deadlines along the way.
                    Each week, we developed specific goals as to what we would accomplish by the end of the week, and we'd get together for a few hours after class to work.
                    
                    I'm quite pleased with the distinct direction this game took to stand out even though it was my second boss rush game.
                    <i>Space Bubby</i> took visual and mechanical influence from The <i>Binding of Isaac</i> and <i>Enter the Gungeon</i>, and was overall sillier in tone with simpler mechanics.
                    Rather than leaning on a variety of player abilities, <i>Space Bubby</i> focuses more on creating a wholly distinct flavor for each enemy encounter.
                    This includes different projectile sprites for every boss, and attack patterns which fully take advantage of the wackiness behind each character design.
                    (The final attacks of The Doggo Roboto and Bad Frog are still among my favorite ideas I've worked on.)
                    
                    The final game was similar in scope to <i>Kuri</i>, with 4 bosses that have 5 attacks each, despite having about half the development time.

                    I had originally wanted to create all of the art and music for the game on my own, but as we progressed it became apparent that this would not be feasible.
                    We decided to reach out to another friend to compose music for us, which allowed us to have a fantastic soundtrack without detracting from the quality of other areas of the game.

                    <b>Organize your work in a motivating way.</b>
                    <br>
                    Art and sound effects are what makes a game feel alive, but for <i>Space Bubby</i> I waited to work on these for far too long.
                    Once I finally got to them, I noticed how much more satisfying it feels to work on a game that's made of more than just abstract rectangles and temp art.
                    Project planning isnâ€™t just about getting the work done, but also organizing the work in a way that feels gratifying and motivating.
