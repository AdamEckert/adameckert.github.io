                    Space Bubby was a spiritual successor to Kuri made for my first video game development class at ASU.
                    I acted as the project lead, and oversaw development in much the same way as I did with Kuri, setting milestones and organizing tasks to be completed each week.

                    I had originally wanted to create all of the art and music for the game on my own, but as we progressed it became apparent that this would not be feasible.
                    We decided to reach out to another friend to compose music for us, which allowed us to have a fantastic soundtrack without detracting from the quality of other areas of the game.

                    <b>Organize your work in a motivating way.</b>
                    <br>
                    Art and sound effects are what makes a game feel alive, but for Space Bubby I waited to work on these for far too long.
                    Once I finally got to them and noticed the change in team morale, I realized that project planning isnâ€™t just about getting the work done, but also organizing the work in a way that feels gratifying and motivating to work on.
