                    <i>Color Phase</i> is a puzzle platformer in which the main character can swap between four different colors, each with their own properties and abilities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I and another design member collaborated to brainstorm and document the abilities of the player character that correspond to his four different colors, and I assisted in level design and implementation throughout.
                    Later in development, I also took up the Assistant Producer role for the design team.
                    This involved taking attendance at meetings, and assisting officers with assigning tasks to members and checking in on their progress.

                    Color Phase’s development was often obstructed by poor file management and inconsistencies in documentation between multiple designers and work sessions.
                    Systems members would often ask the design team questions about what they were implementing, only to learn they were working off of outdated documentation (ask me about “Joey’s Cube”...)
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of this year, I was elected to be a Design Officer, so my first order of business was to create more formal <a href="/projects/docstandards.html">documentation and file management standards</a> to use within the club.
