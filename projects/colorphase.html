                    <i>Color Phase</i> is a color-based puzzle platformer.
                    Play as Hue and swap between four different colors to overcome 20+ puzzles and platforming challenges!

                    During this project, my greatest contributions were in the realm of mechanics documentation.
                    The player character of the game can change into four different colors, each with unique ways of interacting with the game world.
                    Another design member and I collaborated on creating the documentation for these mechanics, including an asset list for all the teams to reference when implementing them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Later in development, I also took up the Assistant Producer role for the Design team.
                    This involved taking attendance at meetings, checking in with members about task progress, and assigning tasks to Design members.

                <div id="section">

                    <b>Keep the project organized so everyone can be on the same page.</b>
                    <br>
                    Color Phase’s development was often obstructed by poor file management and inconsistencies in documentation between multiple designers and work sessions.
                    Systems members would often ask the design team questions about what they were implementing, only to learn they were working off of outdated documentation (ask me about “Joey’s Cube”...)
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of this year, I was elected to be a Design Officer, so my first order of business was to create more formal <a href="/projects/colorphase.html#about">documentation and file management standards</a> to use within the club.
