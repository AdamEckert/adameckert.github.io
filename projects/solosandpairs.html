                    <i>Solos and Pairs</i> was my second game made for GBJam, and I wanted to push myself outside of my typical comfort zone, both mechanically and tonally.
                    Most of my games have had no narrative and focused exclusively on real-time action, so here I decided to make a turn-based RPG with a more wholesome focus on the relationships of your party members.
                    <br><br>
                    Mechanically, you fight enemies with a pair of allies at once, with each pair boasting its own abilities and stats representing their relationship.
                    Overall, I think this turned out very well, and while it could use some conceptual tweaks (your characters' relationships can fall asleep - just go with it) it resulted in a compelling scaffold of new abilites as more party members are unlocked.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm quite proud of the music, too - I got a number of compliments on the game's soundtrack, and it still sometimes gets stuck in my head!

                    <br><br>
                </div>
                
                
                <div id="heading">
                    <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
                </div>
                <div id="section">

                    <b>Do things the smart way, not the hard way!</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When building <i>Solos and Pairs</i>, I anticipated the game's scope to be a tight squeeze for the allotted development time,
                    so I rushed into implementation before considering the needs of the project.
                    Specifically, <i>Solos and Pairs</i> required a far more robust menu system than what I was used to building,
                    so my typical approach quickly became difficult to manage.
                    <br>
                    While I lost time grappling with this unweildy menu system, this experience serves as a reminder that investing in appropriate
                    planning time will save you a headache and be more efficient in the long run.
