                    <i>Solos and Pairs</i> was my second game made for GBJam, and I wanted to push myself outside of my typical comfort zone, both mechanically and tonally.
                    Most of my games have been focused on real-time action, with a threadbare story that amounts to "kill the bad guy" if any at all.
                    So, this time, I decided to go in a different direction with emulating the Game Boy style and made a simple turn-based RPG with a bit more wholesome focus on the relationships of your party members.

                <div id="section">
                    <video class="r" id="video" width="300" height="270" controls>
                        <source src="/videos/sapvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your browser does not support the video tag.
                    </video>
                    Mechanically, you fight enemies with a pair of allies at once, with each pair boasting its own abilities and stats representing their relationship.
                    Overall, I think this turned out very well, and while it could have done with a little more conceptual tweaks (how can a relationship fall asleep or be poisoned?)
                    it resulted in an interesting scaffold of different abilites as more party members are unlocked.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, <i>Solos and Pairs</i> gave me the opportunity to show influence from <i>Dragon Warrior Monsters 2</i> (<i>Dragon Quest Monsters 2</i> in Japan), a Game Boy Color game that was very dear to me as a child, and which served as a reference in a number of ways. (I haven't played any other Dragon Quest games though... I should get on that.)
                    I'm quite proud of the music, too - I got a number of compliments on the game's soundtrack, and it still sometimes gets stuck in my head!

                    <br>
                    When building <i>Solos and Pairs</i>, I was implementing right off the bat, anticipating the game's scope to be a tough squeeze into the alloted development time.
                    As such, I did not take the proper time to re-evaluate my typical approach to development. This was a mistake.
                    <br>
                    As my previous games have so few menus, I haven't needed to make a generalized menu system and opted to hard-code them instead.
                    Despite <i>Solos and Pairs</i> being deeply menu-dependent, I bashed my head against the wall using this same approach, and spent half of the jam in a grueling hell of mind-bending spaghetti code.
                    <br>
                    By the time I thought of a more flexible modular approach, it was too late to change gears.
                    This was a painful experience for me, but was also an extremely valuable lived example of the importance of thinking through your approach to new challenges instead of naively doing what you've always done.
