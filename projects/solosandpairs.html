                    <i>Solos and Pairs</i> was my second game made for GBJam, and I wanted to push myself outside of my typical comfort zone, both mechanically and tonally.
                    Most of my games have had no narrative and focused exclusively on real-time action, so here I decided to make a turn-based RPG with a more wholesome focus on the relationships of your party members.

                <div id="section">
                    <video class="r" id="video" width="350" height="315" controls>
                        <source src="/videos/sapvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                    </video>
                    Mechanically, you fight enemies with a pair of allies at once, with each pair boasting its own abilities and stats representing their relationship.
                    Overall, I think this turned out very well, and while it could use some conceptual tweaks (your characters don't fall asleep, their relationships do - just go with it) it resulted in an compelling scaffold of new abilites as more party members are unlocked.

                    I'm quite proud of the music, too - I got a number of compliments on the game's soundtrack, and it still sometimes gets stuck in my head!

                    When building <i>Solos and Pairs</i>, I anticipated the game's scope to be a tight squeeze for the allotted development time,
                    so I rushed into implementation before considering the needs of the project.
                    Specifically, <i>Solos and Pairs</i> required a far more robust menu system than what I was used to building,
                    so my on-the-fly menus quickly spiraled out into a grueling hell of mind-bending spaghetti code.
                    <br>
                    By the time I thought of a more flexible and modular approach, it was too late to change gears.
                    While my time grappling with this unweildy menu system was painful, I'm glad to have the reminder that it's always worth thinking about other approaches for a moment before jumping in headfirst.
