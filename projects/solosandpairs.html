                    <i>Solos and Pairs</i> was my second game made for GBJam.
                    This time, I decided to go in a different direction with emulating the Gameboy style and made a simple turn-based RPG.
                    The idea originally came from the GMTK 2021 jam theme, "Joined Together", but it was clearly too large for a 48 hour jam.
                    <br>
                    The core mechanic of the game is based on using pairs of party members to fight enemies, and I'm happy with how well that was realized.
                    I am also very happy with the music - I got a number compliments on the game's soundtrack, and it still sometimes gets stuck in my head!
                    <br><br>

                    My goal with <i>Solos and Pairs</i> was to push myself outside of my typical comfort zone.
                    Both in what I enjoy to play and what I am inspired to create, I have historically focused on more action-oriented, real-time games, often with little to no story.
                    Mechanically, <i>Solos and Pairs</i> is obviously different in that it is a turn-based RPG.
                    However, I also wanted to change my narrative focus to create a more "wholesome" vibe.
                    In a way, instead of focusing purely on "These are the cool bad guys that you're gonna kill!" I wanted to include "These are the good guys who are going to work together!"
                    <br><br>
                    My primary inspiration for this game was the Gameboy Color game <i>Dragon Quest Monsters 2</i> (or <i>Dragon Warrior Monsters</i>, as it was originally localized.)
                    I have actually played very few turn-based RPGs, despite being interested in them, as I have difficulty feeling engrossed in their gameplay.
                    <i>DQM2</i> is the only full-length game like this that I have played to completion, and my memories with it are some of my most treasured in my time as a gamer.
