                    My name is Adam Eckert.
                    I am a game designer and 2021 graduate of Arizona State University, where I studied Informatics and took a certificate in video game development at the Fulton School of Engineering.
                    I also was a design officer at the Video Game Development Club at ASU, where I led the design team, developed documentation standards, and trained new members for our annual game projects using Unity.
                    <br><br>
                    Game development is most compelling to me when I'm always working under a new set of limitations.
                    It's invigorating to come up with creative work-arounds and point out the strengths of each game's systems - I always try to experiment during a game jam.
                    When it comes to working on teams, I love language and communication. The opportunities I've had to create documentation to teach and convey ideas to others have been awesome.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking forward, I'm particularly interested in learning about design for accessibility.
                    There are people from every walk of life who want to play games, and accomodating the needs of those who are often overlooked by developers is something I would love to have a part in.
