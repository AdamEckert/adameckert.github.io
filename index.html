                    Welcome to my portfolio website!
                    <br><br>
                    I am a game designer and a 2021 graduate of Arizona State University, where I studied Informatics and took a certificate in video game development at the Fulton Schools of Engineering.
                    I was also a participant in the Video Game Development Club at ASU. Here, I led the Design Team as a Design Officer, developing documentation standards for our annual game projects and training new members on documentation and Unity basics.
                    <br><br>
                    From the moment in my youth that I realized <i>people</i> make the games we play, it has been my goal to be a game developer.
                    At first, I merely thought it would be a cool job.
                    Now that I've learned more about the practical and emotional impacts of design, I realize the power of such work, and hope to create memorable experiences while advocating for inclusivity and accessibility in the gaming sphere.
