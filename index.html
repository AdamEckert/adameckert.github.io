                    <b>My name is Adam Eckert.</b>
                    I am a game designer and 2021 graduate of Arizona State University, where I studied Informatics and took a certificate in video game development at the Fulton School of Engineering.
                    I also was a Design Lead at a student-led game development organization at ASU (publishing under the name <i>Heatwave Studios</i>) <b>where I led the design team by managing task allocation, developing documentation standards, and training new members for our annual game projects in Unity.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Through hobbyist, academic, and <i>Heatwave Studios</i> projects, I have worked on teams ranging from solo development to working with tens of people across multiple teams.
                    <b>I have been learning about and employing SCRUM concepts since high-school, and often find myself in the role of facilitating communication between people with different specialties.</b>
                    I have also coded and produced design documentation for myself and others in a wide array of projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When it comes to solo development, all assets, including code, music, and art, are created by me.
                    <b>I love using each new project to experiment with lots of different styles, mechanics, and ideas.</b>
                    To me, game jams are a great opportunity to test my design and programming chops under a new set of limitations, which has resulted in a lot of projects I am proud of.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking forward, one realm I'm interested in focusing on and learning more about is accessibility.
                    There are people from every walk of life who want to play games, and accomodating the needs of those who are often overlooked is something I would love to have a part in.
